\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
\section{Objectives}
We will cover two important characteristics of HPC at this work. First is data transfer between multiple computers which are doing a task collaboratively.
Second the collaboration itself, i.e. how multiple computers will accomplish a collaborative task. To do this we will discuss distributed workflow management.
To accomplish these objectives we will first define our requirments clearly regarding the above mentioned topics. We will extract the parameters which we will
then assess the other solutions using them. Then we will go through the existing solutions 
which are currently available. Afterwards we will discuss their applicability according to our defined requirements and whether they answer our needs or not.

\section{Structure}
This document is structured in three main conceptual parts.
\subparagraph{Problem} In this part we will introduce the problem domain, the 
requirements and the main problem itself.
\subparagraph{Prior Art} We will discuss prior art in two parts. First is about
distributed data transfer and data access technologies. The second part is about
distributed workflow management.
\subparagraph{Idea} In this part we will focus on our approach to address the
problems which have been discussed in previous chapters.
