Master Thesis
=============

This repository contains my master thesis documentation for Communication and Media Engineering (CME) program in [Hochschule Offenburg] (http://hs-offenburg.de/). I write my thesis documentation using Tex and here I put them.

## Introduction
I am doing my master thesis in the [Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM] (http://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/) in Freiburg Germany. In this institute many compute-intensive scientific experiments are being done hence they utilize High Performance Computing (HPC) solutions.


## Distributed flow control and intelligent data transfer in high performance computing (HPC) networks
My thesis is an effort to analyze the current solutions and suggest better ways to use computing resources and to do more efficient and smarter data transfer over the network.
To read the exact description of the topic please look at the documents.
