\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

Even though there are many solutions designed for HPC problems, still there are requirements for smaller groups which are not satisfied, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Making scientific applications user friendly 
\item Providing \textit{smarter} solutions which get out of users way, i.e. hiding the systems complexity from ordinary users
\item The system manages data endpoints, not users
\item Less deployment and maintenance cost
\item More flexibility to control application at runtime
\end{itemize}
During this work we addressed some of these needs:
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem was defined and requirements where defined
\item We went through the state of the art
\item A solution approach was proposed
\item A prototype was developed
\begin{itemize}
\fontsize{30pt}{31}\selectfont
\item Based on open technologies
\item Runs in user space
\item Open source and freely available on Github
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Our approach is very flexible to be extended and it is easy to build new services on top of the existing framework 
which provides the distributed operation and storage mechanisms to applications.

\section{Future Work}
During this work we have focused on the aspects of the problem which were important in the context 
domain and we left aside many other small and big problems without considering them during this project. The main
reason was that we wanted to work on problems which were new and genuine
because for other aspects there are already many well-defined solutions
available, so we did not spend our time for them. Moreover one should 
consider that this project is not solely an implementation but is a 
research on finding ways to embed distributed solutions into other projects.

In the following sections we talk shortly about the topics which we have
not covered but this work can be extended to include them as well.

\section{Non-linear Operations}
The main part which have not been covered yet is non-linear operations.


\section{Network Discovery}
Currently the peers are configured in the beginning and there is no dynamic peer recognition. This might be done in a number of ways
such as sending broadcasts or using third party projects such as Zyre \cite{Zyre}.

\section{Bootstrapping}
With having address of only one peer we would be able to configure and a new peer and join the network. There should be a mechanism among
peers to identify joining and leaving peers. But our context is different than a peer-to-peer applications which peers join and leave 
frequently. In our case most of peers run a long time and bootstrapping is more a way to get the state of currently running workflows and
let others know about the new peer.

\section{Data Popularity}
There are algorithms developed to calculate data popularity over time and then replicate them over peers for easier access. If we want to 
move toward any type of data replication we would need to use this algorithms.

\section{Security}
There is no user management and secure communication in our initial requirements however this would be required if we want to manage user
rights or introduce limitations or simply to keep a history of activities for each user. Moreover to secure inter-peer communications 
we might use X.509 certificates. Further more since we've used ZeroMQ\cite{ZeroMQ} as underlying transport channel we can use its more advanced
security features such as Elliptic curve cryptography\cite{Curve} based on Curve25519\cite{Curve25519} to add perfect forward secrecy, 
arbitrary authentication backends and so on.

\section{Fault Tolerance}
In current work there is no failure recovery mechanism, since it was not part of the requirements. In case of a failure or exception in any 
collaborating peer not only the failed instance should be able to recover itself into a correct state, moreover the other peers should maintain
a valid state for on-going distributed workflows and keep their internal state up-to-date.
