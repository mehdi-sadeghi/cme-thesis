\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

Even though there are many solutions designed for HPC problems, still there are requirements for smaller groups which are not satisfied, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Making scientific applications user friendly 
\item Providing \textit{smarter} solutions which get out of users way, i.e. hiding the systems complexity from ordinary users
\item The system manages data endpoints, not users
\item Less deployment and maintenance cost
\item More flexibility to control application at runtime
\end{itemize}
During this work we addressed some of these needs:
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem was defined and requirements where defined
\item We went through the state of the art
\item A solution approach was proposed
\item A prototype was developed
\begin{itemize}
\fontsize{30pt}{31}\selectfont
\item Based on open technologies
\item Runs in user space
\item Open source and freely available on Github
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Our approach is very flexible to be extended and it is easy to build new services on top of the existing framework 
which provides the distributed operation and storage mechanisms to applications.
