\section{Identical Instances}
We assume that on each machine of the network the same instance of our program is running which 
is capable of all of our operations
including A, B and C. The only consideration is the availability of 
Datasets, they are not available on all machines.

Assuming that operations A and B will run on the machines which
contain the required data, a number of questions arise here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On which machine operations C should run? A, B or C?
\item On How to transfer the required data to that machine in an 
optimized way?
\end{enumerate}
