\chapter*{Preface}
\label{cha:preface}
This thesis is a research and development effort to accomplish data intensive operations 
in a distributed manner with a collective but decentralized approach toward workflow management 
while minimizing data transfer during such operations.

During this thesis I have been responsible to study the problem of my client,
define it clearly and assist them in finding a proper solution.
Either with finding an already existing approach 
and integrating it into their development process 
or with proposing a new approach to address their needs. 

My activities include analyzing the problem, collecting requirements,
studying state of the art software frameworks and related products,
analyzing them against requirements and
proposing a solution.

In case of proposing a new approach,
it was desired to develop a prototype to demonstrate it.
Therefore an application has been developed in order to experiment ideas discussed in this work. 
This open source application is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mehdisadeghi/konsensus}}
for review.
