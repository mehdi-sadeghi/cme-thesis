\chapter*{Preface}
\label{cha:preface}

European scientific communities launch many experiments everyday, resulting in huge amounts
of data. Specifically in molecular dynamics and material science fields there are many different
simulation softwares which are being used to accomplish multi-scale modeling tasks. These tasks
often involve running multiple simulation programs over the existing datasets or the data which is
produced by other simulation software. It's common to run multiple programs on existing datasets
during one operation to produce the desired results. The order to run simulation software is normally 
defined within scripts written by users. 

Moreovers users have to provide the required data manually and copy all required files to a working
directory to submit their job, and they might have to login to different machines to prepare files,
submit the script, monitor the status of the job and finally collect the output files. 
This type of work routine is a common form of workflow management in above mentioned communities.

While simpler and smaller experiments could be handled this way, larger and more complicated experiments
require different solutions. 

Such experiments are the source of many high performance computing (HPC) problems, specially workflow management and data transfer.
This thesis is an effort accomplish such operations in a distributed manner with a 
collective but decentralized approach toward workflow management and to minimized data transfer during such operations.

During this thesis an open source prototype application has been developed which is available online\footnote{https://github.com/mehdisadeghi/konsensus}. The source files
of the current document are also available\footnote{https://github.com/mehdisadeghi/cme-thesis}.
