      \begin{block}{Introduction}
European scientific communities launch many experiments every day, resulting in huge amounts
of data. Specifically in \textbf{molecular dynamics} and material science fields there are many different
simulation software which are being used to accomplish \textbf{multi scale modeling} tasks. These tasks
often involve running \textbf{multiple simulation programs} over the existing data or the data which is
produced by other simulation software. Depending on the amount of the data and the desired type of simulation
these tasks could take many days to finish. The runtime order of these softwares and 
their input data are normally defined in \textbf{scripts written by users} which is the simplest
form of workflow management.

Such experiments are the source of many high performance computing (HPC) problems, specially data transfer
and workflow management. This thesis is an effort to know the \textbf{main data transfer scenarios} in HPC experiments 
and try to address them in a distributed manner with a collective but decentralized approach toward workflow management
and dataset storage and query.

      \end{block}
      
      \begin{block}{Requirements}
      The main ones as exported during the meetings are these:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data location is unknow} to users
        \item User should have same experience regardless of the peer to which she connects.
        \item System should have \textbf{no central brokers}.
        \item Required data are distributed on the network.
        \item \textbf{Runtime control} over task execution.
        \item The solution should be \textbf{distributed}.
        \item Easily deployable.
        \item \textbf{User space} solution
        \item Light weight
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Related Work}
        Many scientific groups have produced tools to facilitate workflow management, job scheduling,
        service discovery, resource management and etc. Some of these are very localized and some are
        too heavy for an agile group to launch and maintain it. The job schedulers and queue management
        systems such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE) are tailored toward job management and they do not give
        control over task executions in runtime.
        Here are a number of similar works:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item UNICORE: is a grid computing technology for resources such as supercomputers or cluster systems and information stored in databases.\cite{unicore}
        \item Distributed File Systems, centralized or decentralized
        \item Porto: The Porto platform will provide a lightweight and flexible system for data and workflow management.\cite{porto}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}



      \begin{block}{Main Scenarios}
      We categorize every possible operation into two main groups:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Linear} operations. These operations could be run in parallel. The algebraic notation of this operation would be:
      \[ Operation(A + B) = Operation(A) + Operation(B) \]
      \item \textbf{Non-linear} operations. These operations are not equal to previous one, they can't be run in parallel:
      \[ Operation(A + B) \neq Operation(A) + Operation(B) \]
      \end{enumerate}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Proposed Solution}
      \textbf{We need only to solve two problems}:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item How to solve an operation on one dataset?
      \item How to solve a non-linear operation on two datasets?
      \end{enumerate}
      \textbf{We break down all others into combinations of these two scenarios.}
      
      We propose to make a peer-to-peer collaborative application which will run on every resource (computer) in our network, this computer (which we call it peer) will then become one part of the network. In the beginning there is one peer network but this network can be extended to contain multiple other peers. Here are main characteristics:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The solution is \textbf{peer-to-peer}
      \item \textbf{Not a client/server} notion
      \item Based on publish-subscribe pattern
      \item Operations are \textbf{asynchronous}
      \item API calls return an \textbf{operation unique ID}
      \item Distribute operation store will be synchronized with peers
      \item \textbf{Peers subscribe to each other}
      \item Every \textbf{pear publishes news} on every \textbf{state changes}
      \item Peer can launch operations \textbf{recursively} on itself or others
%      \item Peers can launch operations on others
      \item Peers keep state for \textbf{Operations}, \textbf{Datasets} and other \textbf{peer list}
      \item Peers and application components are \textbf{loosely coupled}
      \end{itemize}
      
      In our design the simplest operation is not dependent on any other operation, and we know how to handle it. Other operations are made from these atomic solutions.
      
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{A Sample Scenario}
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item User sends \(Op(A + B) \) to a \textbf{random} peer and gets an ID
      \item The peer stores this operation in a \textbf{distributed store}
      \item System breaks this to \(Op(A) + Op(B) \) and \textbf{self-launches} them \textbf{asynchronously}.
      \item Upon completion of sub-operations a random peer will store the result on the network and notify others
      \end{enumerate}

      \end{block}
	  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
	  Even though there are many solutions designed for HPC problems, still there are requirements for agile groups which are not satisfied, such as user friendly \textit{smart} applications which hide the complexity
	  of the data query and storage from end users, less deploy and maintenance cost and more flexibility and control over the application.
	  During this work we tried to address these needs and create a light weight
	  solution based on open technologies which run in user space and allows running simple and complicated scenarios over the data. Our approach is very flexible to be extended and it is easy to build new services on top
	  of the existing framework which provides the distributed operation and storage mechanisms to applications.
