      \begin{block}{Introduction}
Scientific experiments are the source of many high performance computing (HPC) problems. Here are
some highlights:

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple simulation programs run during one operation
\item Huge data is being used by these programs
\item Data is being produced and used on the fly
\item Simplest form of workflow management is wrting scripts
\item Users have to manage input/output files manually
\item Job schedulers have control over execution process
\end{itemize}

      This thesis is an effort to:% bring \textbf{control} and \textbf{ease of use} in above context:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Accomplish operations on a distributed network collectively
      \item Make users neglectful of data location
      \item Propose a decentralized approach toward workflow management
      \item Avoid unnecessary data transfer
      \end{itemize}

      \end{block}
      
      \begin{block}{Requirements}
      The main ones as exported during the meetings are these:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data location is unknow} to users
        \item User should have same experience regardless of the peer to which she connects.
        \item System should have \textbf{no central brokers}.
        \item Required data are distributed on the network.
        \item \textbf{Runtime control} over task execution.
        \item The solution should be \textbf{distributed}.
        \item Easily deployable.
        \item \textbf{User space} solution
        \item Light weight
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Related Work}
        There are simliar solutions, some very localized and some too big for small groups to handle:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item UNICORE: a grid computing technology for resources such as supercomputers or cluster systems and information stored in databases.\cite{unicore}
        \item Distributed File Systems, centralized or decentralized
        \item Porto: The Porto platform will provide a lightweight and flexible system for data and workflow management.\cite{porto}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}


      \begin{block}{Main Scenarios}
      We categorize every possible operation into two main groups:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Linear}. These operations could be run in parallel. The algebraic notation would be:
      \[ Operation(A + B) = Operation(A) + Operation(B) \]
      \item \textbf{Non-linear}. These operations are different, they can't be run in parallel:
      \[ Operation(A + B) \neq Operation(A) + Operation(B) \]
      \end{enumerate}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Internal Components}
      This figures demonstrates the main components which form the internals of each peer:\\

    \begin{column}{.45\textwidth}

      \begin{block}{Proposed Solution}
      \textbf{We need only to solve two problems}:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item How to solve an operation on one dataset?
      \item How to solve a non-linear operation on two datasets?
      \end{enumerate}
      \textbf{We break down all others into combinations of these two scenarios.}
      
      We propose to make a peer-to-peer collaborative application which will run on every resource 
      (computer) in our network, this computer (which we call it peer) will then become one part of 
      the network. In the beginning there is one peer network but this network can be extended to contain
      multiple other peers. Here are main characteristics:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The solution is \textbf{peer-to-peer}
      \item \textbf{Not a client/server} notion
      \item Based on \textbf{publish-subscribe} pattern
      \item Operations are \textbf{asynchronous}
      \item API calls return a \textbf{unique operation ID}
      \item Distributed operation store will be synchronized with peers
      \item \textbf{Peers subscribe to each other}
      \item Every \textbf{pear publishes news} on every \textbf{state changes}
      \item Peer can launch operations \textbf{recursively} on itself or others
%      \item Peers can launch operations on others
      \item Peers keep state for \textbf{Operations}, \textbf{Datasets} and other \textbf{peer list}
      \item Peers and application components are \textbf{loosely coupled}
      \end{itemize}
      
      In our design the simplest operation is not dependent on any other operation, and we know how to handle it. Other operations are made from these atomic ones.
      
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{A Sample Scenario}
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item User sends \(Op(A + B) \) to a \textbf{random} peer and gets an ID
      \item The peer stores this operation in a \textbf{distributed store}
      \item System breaks this to \(Op(A) + Op(B) \) and \textbf{self-launches} them \textbf{asynchronously}.
      \item Upon completion of sub-operations a random peer will store the result on the network and notify others
      \end{enumerate}

      \end{block}
	  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
	  Even though there are many solutions designed for HPC problems, still there are requirements for smaller groups which are not satisfied, such as:
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item Making scientific applications user friendly 
	  \item Providing \textit{smarter} solutions which get out of users way, i.e. hiding the systems complexity from ordinary users
	  \item Let system manages data endpoints, not users
	  \item Less deploy and maintenance cost
	  \item More flexibility to control application at runtime
	  \end{itemize}
	  During this work we addressed some of these needs:
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item The problem was defined and requirements where defined
	  \item We went through the state of the art
	  \item A solution approach were propsed
	  \item A prototype developed
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \fontsize{27pt}{28}\selectfont
	  \item Based on open technologies
	  \item Runs in user space
	  \item Open source and freely available on Github\cite{konsensus}
	  \end{itemize}
	  \end{itemize}
	  Our approach is very flexible to be extended and it is easy to build new services on top of the existing framework 
	  which provides the distributed operation and storage mechanisms to applications.
