      \begin{block}{Introduction}
European scientific communities launch many scientific experiments daily, resulting in huge amounts
of data. Specifically in molecular dynamics and material science fields there are many different
simulation software which are being used to accomplish multiscale modelling tasks. These tasks
often involve running multiple simulation programs over the existing data or the data which is
produced by other simulation software. Depending on the amount of the data and the desired type of simulation
these tasks could take many days to finish. The runtime order of these softwares and 
their input data are normally defined in scripts written by researchers which is the simplest
form of workflow management.

%In the above mentioned context it's common that programs start processing some existing data models e.g. human genome
%or physical models data and often simulation programs should be coupled together to produce the final result.
%Moreover the required data to launch an operation might not be available locally and should be fetched from the network.
%Then these coupled programs will need to exchange data at runtime.

Such experiments are the source of many high performance computing (HPC) problems, specially data transfer
and workflow management. This thesis is an effort to know the main data transfer scenarios in HPC experiments 
and try to address them in a distributed manner with a collective but decentralized approach toward workflow management
and dataset storage and query.

      \begin{block}{Requirements}
      The main requirments as exported during the meetins are these:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item User has no idea where the required data is located.
        \item User should have same experience regardless of the peer to which she connects.
        \item System should have no central brokers.
        \item Required data are distributed on the network.
        \item Runtime control over task execution.
        \item The solution should be distributed.
        \item Easily deployable.
        \end{itemize}

      \begin{block}{Related Work}
        Many scientific groups have produced tools to faciliate workflow management, job scheduling,
        service discovery, resource management and etc. Some of these are very localized and some are
        too heavy for an agile group to launch and maintain it. The job schedulers and queue management
        systems such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE) are tailored toward job management and they do not give
        control over task executions in runtime.
